* TransformationTool *
- Size of axes should be proportional to distance between camera and object.
- (PARTIALLY DONE!) Make axes look nice by rendering cylinders and cones.
- (PARTIALLY DONE!) Dragging an axis should involve projection to 2d and movent should
  increase when dragging mouse in the (2d) direction of the axis.
- axes should always point in x, y, z world coordinates
  direction. This means that transformations should zero out rotations.
- DONE! -- fix transformation node selection so that scene graph is not
  (observationaly) modified.
- DONE! Make sure that all selected object are affected by transformations. 
- introduce floating button graphics over selection to change
  transformation mode (translate, rotate, scale). Consider if buttons
  should fade away or be activated in a certain way (they should not
  block the view!)

- create toolchain abstraction containing multiple tools.

- create button collection abstraction to hide away ugly code

- create plugable transform strategies to switch between translation, rotation 
  and scaling (note: this may also cause different visualization of the tool.

- IDEA: Each viewport should be associated with it's own unique toolchain.
        Only Render tools on the active viewport?

- Consider not using an event queue and simply fire events instantaniously.
  would eliminate construction and destruction of events.
* CameraTool *

introduce meta buttons to activate camera rotation and movement.
